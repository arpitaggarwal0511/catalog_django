# Product Catalog (Django Demo)

This is a small Django project built to demonstrate the basics of:

- Creating a Django backend  
- Working with models and migrations  
- Displaying products on a page  
- Searching and filtering  
- Returning JSON responses  
- Rendering templates  
- Deploying a Django app on Render  

It is not a full e-commerce website.  
The goal is to showcase backend understanding in a simple and clean way.
